# Classmate Contributions 📥

If you're not comfortable with git in powershell or Linux terminal, just drop your files here!

How to add your code:
1. Click "Add file → Upload files" (big green button above)
2. Drag your code snippets in a .cpp, or comments/notes in a .txt file here
3. In the commit message write your name + what it does
4. Choose "Commit directly to the main branch" (safe because we'll review later)
5. Click Commit!
6. Code can then be merged into main program once tested.
