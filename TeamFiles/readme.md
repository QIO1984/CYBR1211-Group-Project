If you're not comfortable with git in powershell or Linux terminal to push and pull code, just drop your files here!

If you're like, "what is GitHub, anyways?"...Watch this for a quick and dirty tutorial: https://youtu.be/a9u2yZvsqHA?si=Uw664OaC10j6ShCh

How to add your code:
1. Look above to make sure you are in /TeamFiles/ folder.
2. Click "Add file → Upload files" (Top Right)
3. Drag your code snippets in a .cpp, or comments/notes in a .txt file here
4. In the commit message write your name + what the code does, or any other relevant info.
5. Choose "Commit directly to the main branch" (safe because we'll review later)
6. Click Commit!
7. Code can then be merged into main program once tested.
