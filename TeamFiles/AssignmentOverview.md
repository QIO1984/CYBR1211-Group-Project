# ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
This assignment will give you more experience working as a team on the use of:
1. Loops & Files
2. Decision Structures
3. Functions
4. Structures
5. Menus
In this project, you will work in teams of 2-3 students to use C++ to develop a library management program that maintains the library book list. The goal is to ensure that all team members participate and share the load of the work and produce a working program.
The program must allow the librarian to add copies of books, add clients, let a client check out (i.e., borrow) books, and let a client check-in (i.e., return) books.
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION / SPECIFICATIONS
In this programming assignment, you will develop a project that implements an engineering library. You will implement and test structures in this project. They are the BookType, ClientRecord.
Functions needed for the program are:

● A addBook function
● A addClient function
● A saveBookList function
● A borrowBook function.
● A returnBook function.
Structures should include:

● The six comparison operators.
● The assignment operator=.
● The operator << (as a friend function).
## DELIVERABLES
Present the project to your class with all the function definitions and the main function.
1. Specify the file as "yourteaminitials_library.cpp"
2. You will upload this file to Blackboard.
3. Also, upload a presentation of your program. 
    a. This should be a recording of your team presentation, edited together or recorded using collaborative video presentation software such as Collaborate, Teams, or Zoom. 
    b. The presentation should be 10-12 minutes in length. 
4. This is a chance to do the following:
    a. Demonstrate the functionality of your program
    b. Show your code and talk about how it works
    c. Discuss the experience of working as a team, highlight the positives each member brought to the project.
