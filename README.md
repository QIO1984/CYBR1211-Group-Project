# CYBR1211-Group-Project
C++ Library Inventory Managment App

## Initial Instructions
- I have "found" a sample project for reference. It essentially works as expected.
- To run, download examplecode.cpp and inventory.txt and place them in the folder where you run VSCode.
- Open examplecode.cpp and run it. Program reads/writes inventory in the text file.
- The sample code is only to provide a reference for the code we will create.

## Teamwork
- Visit the TeamFiles folder and check out the readme.md!
